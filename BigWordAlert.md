## Big Word Alert

- fist-class functions: everything you can do with other types, you can do with functions (i.e. set variable equals to string/number/function)
- function expression: a block of code that results in a value (bc functions in JS are first-class)
- invoke: run/call the function
- commonJS modules: an agreed upon standard for how modules should be structured in JS
- module: a reusable block (of code) whose existence doesn't impact other code
- name/value pair: a name which maps to a value (eg: address = "100 Main St.")
- object: a collection of name/value pairs
- object literal: name/value pairs that are separatd by commas, and surrounded by curly braces
- function constructors: a function that construct object, and the "this" keyword points to a new empty object
- inheritance: one obj gets access to the propreties and methods of another obj
- prototype object: an object that acts as a blueprint for creating instances of a particular type, the object you create then inherits these methods from the prototype.
- primitive (by value): a type of data that represnets a single value (like a number or a string), in other words, not an object (by reference).
- IIFE: Immediately Invoked Function Expressions
- scope: where in code you have access to a particular variable or function.
