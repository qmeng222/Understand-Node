## Big Word Alert

- commonJS modules: an agreed upon standard for how modules should be structured in JS
- fist-class functions: everything you can do with other types, you can do with functions (i.e. set variable equals to string/number/function)
- function expression: a block of code that results in a value (bc functions in JS are first-class)
- invoke: run/call the function
- module: a reusable block (of code) whose existence doesn't impact other code
